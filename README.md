# Robotic-base-design_Mobile-Robot-Base
## This repository is about creating a Mobile Robot Base. Here is a list of the files I created with a simplified explanation:

* ### Robot Arm 

I used Tinkercad website. First I put the (Base) piece Then I put the (Waist) piece and I had the base of the arm. Then I connected Links (Arm 1, Arm 2) and finally i put (Gripper) But the size must be taken into account, it must match the rest arm.

* ### End effector 

I used Tinkercad website for design the (Gripper).
