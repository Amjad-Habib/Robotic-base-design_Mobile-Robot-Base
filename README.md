## This repository is about creating a Mobile Robot Base. Here is a list of the files I created with a simplified explanation:

* ### Robotic Base 

I used Tinkercad website. First i designed the base, which is a (box) and I chose the size proportional to the robot, then I designed the (boxes) for the tire motors and placed the tires. I also designed a (hidden box) inside the base box and finally, I installed the (robotic arm) in the middle of the beginning of the base so that it was away from the tires and the hidden box..
